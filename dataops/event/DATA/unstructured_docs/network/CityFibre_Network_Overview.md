# Eutelsat Network Overview (Demo)

## Footprint & Coverage
- Multi-orbit network combining a high-throughput GEO fleet (35 satellites) with the OneWeb LEO constellation (~600 satellites) for pole-to-pole coverage.
- Broadcast neighbourhoods plus mobility/enterprise beams serving land, sea, and air use cases; nearly 7,000 TV channels (~1,400 HD) and 1,100 radio stations reaching 274M homes.
- Longstanding video reach with 6,400+ TV channels to ~1B viewers (site), alongside growing mobility/backhaul footprint.

## Performance
- GEO for ubiquitous coverage and managed QoS; LEO for low-latency, high-throughput mobility/backhaul.
- Typical metrics to report: availability/SLA, latency bands (GEO vs LEO), jitter, packet loss, capacity utilisation by beam/gateway.
- Proactive monitoring via NOC/SOC; multi-orbit resiliency and failover.

## Services
- Broadcast & Video: DTH/DTT distribution, contribution, managed platforms, Sat.TV EPG, fast channels.
- Aviation & Maritime: inflight connectivity and high-speed maritime links with seamless GEO/LEO handover.
- Enterprise & Backhaul: community WiFi, education, energy/mining, retail/banking resilience, “Backhaul on Wheels,” rural/mobile backhaul.
- Government: secure, assured connectivity for civil/defence, disaster recovery, and humanitarian assistance.
- Telecom: cellular backhaul and transmission for underserved regions.

## Resilience & Operations
- Multi-orbit routing policies for SLA adherence; gateway diversity where available; monitored spectrum usage.
- Incident response: NOC/SOC with proactive alerts and incident communications to partners.
- Activation lead times vary by service (mobility kits vs fixed gateways); track blockers such as licensing, ground site readiness, or equipment logistics.

## Partners & Interconnect
- Broadcasters, airlines, maritime operators, enterprises, governments, and MNOs.
- Partner ecosystems for ground equipment and managed service delivery; interconnect with terrestrial backhaul partners.
