## Capital & Funding
- Nov 2025: €828m reserved capital increase completed; second round rights issue scheduled 25/11/25–09/12/25 (site).
- Funding supports multi-orbit growth (GEO + OneWeb LEO), mobility/backhaul expansion, and balance sheet strength (see consolidated accounts FY25 and URD amendment).

## Revenue & Segments (illustrative for demo)
- Segments: Broadcast & Video (video neighbourhoods, managed platforms, Sat.TV), Aviation & Maritime connectivity, Enterprise/Community WiFi, Government/Defence, Telecom backhaul & transmission.
- Monetisation drivers: long-term broadcast contracts, mobility bandwidth/managed services, backhaul capacity, and managed platform value-add.

## Key Operating Metrics (illustrative anchors)
- Scale: nearly 7,000 TV channels (~1,400 HD) and 1,100 radio stations to 274M homes; 40+ years delivering for customers (site/Wikipedia).
- Network: 35 GEO satellites plus ~600 LEO in OneWeb; GEO for coverage and QoS; LEO for low-latency mobility/backhaul; focus on availability, latency, jitter, and capacity utilisation.
- Growth levers: mobility/enterprise uptake, cross-selling managed platforms, upsell to higher bandwidth tiers, and expanded LEO footprint.

## Cost & Investment Themes (demo assumptions)
- Major cost lines: fleet capex/leases, gateway expansion, spectrum/ground infrastructure, customer equipment for mobility/backhaul, platform operations.
- Efficiency levers: beam/gateway optimisation, multi-orbit traffic steering, platform automation, disciplined capex phasing.
- Cash uses: satellite/fleet investments, LEO integration, ESG initiatives (responsible space, digital inclusion), ground infrastructure refresh.

## Compliance & ESG (summary)
- Commitments documented in Sustainability Statement: responsible space, digital inclusion, and earth/space environment.
- Security and service assurance for government/defence customers; compliance with relevant spectrum/licensing regimes.
