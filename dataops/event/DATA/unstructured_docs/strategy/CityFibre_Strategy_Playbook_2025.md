# Eutelsat Strategy Playbook (Demo, 2025)

## Vision
Operate the leading multi-orbit GEO + LEO network delivering resilient broadcast, mobility, enterprise, telecom backhaul, and government connectivity with trusted, secure service quality.

## 2025 Priorities (site + provided investor/ESG reports)
- Expand multi-orbit reach: optimise GEO capacity while scaling OneWeb LEO for low-latency mobility/backhaul.
- Grow vertical depth: Broadcast & Video (video neighbourhoods, managed platforms), Aviation/Maritime IFC, Enterprise/backhaul, Government/Defence, Telecom backhaul.
- Performance & resilience: maintain high availability, reduce latency for LEO services, proactive congestion management by beam/gateway.
- Customer experience: SLA-backed services, faster activation, and tighter incident comms for mission-critical customers.
- ESG & responsible space: execute sustainability commitments (responsible space, digital inclusion, earth/space environment).

## Market Position
- Differentiators: first GEO–LEO satellite network, 40+ years of trust, 6,400+ TV channels and ~1B viewers (Eutelsat website), global multi-orbit coverage.
- Competitors: other GEO operators and emerging LEO constellations; terrestrial substitutes where available; differentiation via resiliency and vertical expertise.

## Go-To-Market Motions
- Broadcast: protect/extend video neighbourhoods; promote UHD/Fast Channels and Sat.TV EPG.
- Mobility: bundle seamless GEO/LEO for aviation and maritime with managed QoS and roaming agreements.
- Enterprise & Backhaul: community WiFi, energy/mining, retail/banking resilience, and “Backhaul on Wheels” for rapid restoration.
- Government & Defence: secure, assured links with sovereignty options, disaster recovery, and humanitarian surge kits.

## KPIs (examples for the agent)
- Availability/SLA by service; latency and jitter for GEO vs LEO; congestion/headroom by beam/gateway.
- Revenue and margin by vertical; contract pipeline for mobility/backhaul; churn/renewals for broadcast.
- Activation lead times and incident MTTR; NPS/CSAT by segment.
- ESG metrics: responsible space actions, digital inclusion programmes, environmental impact KPIs.
