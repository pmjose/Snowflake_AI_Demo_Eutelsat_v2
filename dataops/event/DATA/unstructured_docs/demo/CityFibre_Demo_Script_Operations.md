# Eutelsat Operations Demo Script (Network & Service Delivery)

## Goal
Show how the agent answers multi-orbit performance, capacity planning, and service delivery questions across GEO + LEO.

## Prompts to try
- “Show availability, latency, and jitter by service type (Broadcast, Aviation IFC, Maritime, Enterprise backhaul) for the last 30 days; flag hotspots.”
- “Where do we need additional gateways or spectrum optimisation to support LEO load growth?”
- “List top maritime or aviation routes with highest utilisation and any congestion alerts.”
- “Summarize SLA performance for government and enterprise customers, including any recent incidents.”
- “What ESG controls and debris mitigation practices are documented in the Sustainability Statement?”
- “How many active GEO and LEO satellites are in service and which regions/beams are most utilised?”

## Narrative
1) **Availability & Latency**: Request trends for GEO vs LEO and by service category; expect hotspot callouts and mitigation steps.
2) **Capacity & Planning**: Ask about gateway load, beam utilisation, and where to expand throughput for mobility/backhaul.
3) **Service Delivery**: Ask for install/activation cycle times for new IFC, maritime, or backhaul deployments and blockers (spectrum, regulatory, ground infra).
4) **Security & Government**: Ask for resilience posture for defence/secure links and recent drills or failovers.
5) **Sustainability**: Pull highlights from ESG content (responsible space, digital inclusion, earth & space environment).
