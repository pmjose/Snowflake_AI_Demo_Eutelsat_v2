# Eutelsat CEO Demo Script (Exec Summary)

## Goal
Show instant answers on multi-orbit coverage, service performance, vertical solutions, and investor-grade metrics using the Eutelsat Executive Agent.

## Prompts to try
- “Summarize GEO + LEO coverage, capacity headroom, and recent availability.”
- “Break down revenue by vertical (Broadcast & Video, Aviation, Maritime, Enterprise, Government, Telecom backhaul).”
- “What did the latest consolidated accounts and FY24/25 investor presentation say about growth drivers?”
- “How many TV channels and end-viewers do we serve today, and what is the mix of HD/UHD?”
- “Where do we need new gateways or spectrum refarming to support LEO growth?”

## Narrative
1) **Coverage & Capacity**: Ask for GEO vs LEO footprint and capacity utilisation; highlight multi-orbit resiliency (GEO + OneWeb LEO) and headroom for mobility/backhaul.
2) **Performance**: Request uptime/latency trends by service (Broadcast, Aviation IFC, Maritime, Government); confirm SLA adherence and any hotspots needing mitigation.
3) **Commercial Mix**: Ask for revenue/ARR by vertical and product family (video distribution, managed platforms, aero/maritime connectivity, backhaul on wheels, government secure links).
4) **Investors & Funding**: Use the executive agent to summarise the URD amendment, consolidated accounts FY25, and FY24/25 investor presentations; capture cash, leverage, and capex plans.
5) **Sustainability & ESG**: Ask for key commitments from the Sustainability Statement (responsible space, digital inclusion, earth & space environment).
