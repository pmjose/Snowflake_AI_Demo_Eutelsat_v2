# Guidelines for Creating New Content

1. **Temporal Consistency**: Reference the Nov 2024 administration event for NRNT
2. **Show Relationships**: Companies naturally reference partners and competitors
3. **Use Real Quotes**: CEO quotes from companies.csv story field
4. **Reflect Stock Movements**: NRNT crashed, SNOW recovered
5. **Partnership Networks**: DFLX/STRM/VLTA/CTLG work with all data platforms
